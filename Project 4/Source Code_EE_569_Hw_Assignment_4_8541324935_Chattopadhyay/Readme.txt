The Python codes were compiled on Anaconda on Spyder - Python 3.2 GUI.

Additionally, Saak Tensorflow Master toolbox is availaible on Github and should be downloaded. The mnist.py is to be replaced by the file 
in this folder. It can be downloaded at: https://github.com/morningsyj/Saak-tensorflow

For homework, first download and install tensorflow and keras into Annaconda. This can be done by typing on Annaconda command prompt:
conda install tensorflow
conda install keras

Also install spyder IDE on anaconda as it is easier to visualize and interpret results on the spyder IDE. You can directly open the files
on the spyder IDE and run them. For Saak transform, it is necesarray to keep the code file mnist.py inside the folder downloaded as 
the data folder is kept inside the folder.

You can also run the files on anaconda prompt by typing: python filename.py

If you get any library missing error, then install that library to Annaconda.
